## Ideas

- Add traditional characters
- Allow users to mark cards as known/unknown for personalized practice
- Add colors to represent each tone in Pinyin for better visual distinction
- Implement a progress tracker to show study stats

## Note on CSV format

The vocabulary data is stored in header-less CSV files with
character, pinyin, and English:
